# Next.js 15 - Async Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js 15 applications involving asynchronous data fetching.  When a page component attempts to use data fetched asynchronously before the data is fully loaded, it might result in undefined values, rendering errors, or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/data`). However, the component tries to access and render the fetched data (`data`) immediately without checking whether the asynchronous operation has completed. This leads to the `data` variable being initially undefined, causing rendering problems.

## Solution

The solution involves using async/await and ensuring data is fetched and available before attempting to render it. This can be done by checking if the data is available before rendering it or by using a loading state to display a placeholder while waiting for the data.
